# Naive-Bayes
Write a program to implement the Naïve Bayes Algorithm for a classification problem. You will implement the exact algorithm taught in the course. Implementing the m-estimate part is not a requirement, but it’s not a problem if you incorporate that in your code. The program will take one input: a dataset with multiple features (at least 3) where the last column is the class variable. The input to your program will be a training and a testing dataset. The output will be overall accuracy which will be printed on the console. All features will be categorical in the datasets and the last column will contain class values. You cannot use any library for the naïve Bayes algorithm or accuracy calculation. However, you can use libraries for handling data files, finding unique values and counting frequencies.
